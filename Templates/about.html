            <i class="caret right icon"> </i> Pesticides used by organic farmers are naturally developed, which are said to be less toxic.<br/>
            <i class="caret right icon"> </i> Health risks can arise from consuming too much food that has been contaminated with pesticides. For example, the commonly used pesticide roundup has been linked to <br/>                     delays in the development of infants.<br/>
            <i class="caret right icon"> </i> Fresh, organic foods contain more of vitamin C and A and fiber than packed foods.<br/>
            <i class="caret right icon"> </i> Cattle raised with conventional farming methods have an unusual diet, which can lead to an increased risk of heart disease if they are consumed.<br/>
            <i class="caret right icon"> </i> Eating organic can reduce your risk of your health being comprimised. Especially if you are pregnant, elderly, or suffering from allergies.<br/>

                <i class="caret right icon"> </i> Shopping Local keeps money within the local economy. Fewer or no payments will be made to larger distributors and corporations.<br/>
                <i class="caret right icon"> </i> In order to make the long journey from a farm to a dinner table, crops are picked while they are still unripe, and thus need to be manipulated with chemicals once they <br/>                         arrive into the local ecosystem.<br/>
                <i class="caret right icon"> </i>  Keeping food production local ensures that the food will be ripe throughout its entire journey.<br/>
